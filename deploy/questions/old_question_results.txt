 --- Mono develops high-quality cloud-based solutions for all cloud service
 --- models and environments. Mono team has been working with different
 --- cloud-based environments for more than 10 years. We have started with
 --- Amazons Elastic Compute Cloud and adopted Microsoft Azure services
 --- right after their official release in 2010. In parallel with our work
 --- with these public clouds, we have built and used complex private cloud
 --- environments, as well as hybrid models. Today, almost all of our

 --- significant experience with all cloud service models, including
 --- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), type of online services that hide
 --- the low-level details of underlying network infrastructure and
 --- physical resources via virtualization. This allows businesses to
 --- purchase resources on demand and as needed, instead of having to buy
 --- hardware outright, but still requires significant skills to maintain
 --- the infrastructure. Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides developers
 --- with a framework they can use to build custom applications upon,
 --- without having to deal with data serving, storage, management, and
 --- similar tasks.   Software as a Service (Saas) refers to cloud-based
 --- software solutions that are hosted online and are available for
 --- purchase on a subscription basis. Backend as a Service (BaaS) provides
 --- application developers with a mechanism to connect their applications
 --- to cloud storage and other computing services with APIs and SDKs
 --- exposed to their applications. We even built a complete BaaS solution
 --- from scratch and are using it as a backbone of many of our own

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---   Our Development process. Business requirements are constantly
 --- evolving, so we use an agile, iterative and incremental approach to
 --- support and encourage these natural course changes.  We will work with
 --- you to blueprint a system that can be built efficiently to meet your
 --- needs. The idea is to help you define a minimal viable product, the
 --- first usable form of your application. Your requirements are broken
 --- down into small and manageable parts. Each of them describes a small
 --- piece of work needed to achieve results. This is where we start to get
 --- a sense of the amount of work involved. The time and price estimate
 --- for your new application is based on estimates for each individual
 --- task defined in the previous step. Summing it all up gives us the
 --- estimated completion date. Requirements can be added or changed at any
 --- time. Before development starts, all tasks are added to the product
 --- backlog - a list of requirements for a product. It contains everything
 --- needed to successfully deliver a viable product. A sprint (or
 --- iteration) is the basic unit of development. It usually lasts for a
 --- week or two and aims to implement a fixed number of backlog items. The
 --- goal of each sprint is to have a system that is integrated and ready
 --- for delivery. At the end of a sprint, the team reviews the sprint to
 --- articulate lessons learned and check progress. A new set of backlog
 --- items is chosen for the next sprint, and the work continues until the
 --- product is ready for the market. This process increases the quality of
 --- the final product, copes with changes, provides better estimates
 --- without spending too much time on them, and allows you to be more in
 --- control of the project schedule and state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- Mono development team can build mobile apps for every platform and
 --- purpose, using a wide array of cross-platform tools. We have started
 --- building mobile apps for iOS and Android platform using native
 --- development tools (Objective-C and Swift for iOS and Java for
 --- Android). More recently we have switched most of our projects to
 --- cross-development tools, using write-once-run-anywhere approach. Our
 --- mobile app projects share great amounts of code between platforms,
 --- enabling us to deliver mobile solutions at a fraction of the time and
 --- cost needed to build separate versions for each platform. In parallel
 --- with native development tools, we started using the first generation
 --- cross-platform JavaScript tools - PhoneGap and Ionic - a while ago.
 --- Their performance was not spectacular, so we switched to Xamarin
 --- quickly, as it was much better in terms of performance and
 --- functionality. It has also allowed us to utilize our large base of
 --- experienced C# developers to cover desktop, Web and mobile application
 --- development using a single set of tools. As React Native gained wider
 --- adoption, we started to use it in parallel with Xamarin; once again we
 --- were able to reuse our existing knowledge of JavaScript to build
 --- advanced mobile apps. More recently, we have started using Flutter and
 --- Dart to build fast and powerful mobile solutions, as it introduces
 --- additional performance improvements for developers. We have mastered a
 --- wide array of mobile development tools and can implement all kinds of
 --- mobile software solutions per your specifications. Usage of cross-
 --- platform tools allows us to cover multiple platforms quickly and
 --- efficiently.

question - How do you estimate time and price for an app?

answer - Summing it all up gives us the estimated completion date.

 ---   Our Development process. Business requirements are constantly
 --- evolving, so we use an agile, iterative and incremental approach to
 --- support and encourage these natural course changes.  We will work with
 --- you to blueprint a system that can be built efficiently to meet your
 --- needs. The idea is to help you define a minimal viable product, the
 --- first usable form of your application. Your requirements are broken
 --- down into small and manageable parts. Each of them describes a small
 --- piece of work needed to achieve results. This is where we start to get
 --- a sense of the amount of work involved. The time and price estimate
 --- for your new application is based on estimates for each individual
 --- task defined in the previous step. Summing it all up gives us the
 --- estimated completion date. Requirements can be added or changed at any
 --- time. Before development starts, all tasks are added to the product
 --- backlog - a list of requirements for a product. It contains everything
 --- needed to successfully deliver a viable product. A sprint (or
 --- iteration) is the basic unit of development. It usually lasts for a
 --- week or two and aims to implement a fixed number of backlog items. The
 --- goal of each sprint is to have a system that is integrated and ready
 --- for delivery. At the end of a sprint, the team reviews the sprint to
 --- articulate lessons learned and check progress. A new set of backlog
 --- items is chosen for the next sprint, and the work continues until the
 --- product is ready for the market. This process increases the quality of
 --- the final product, copes with changes, provides better estimates
 --- without spending too much time on them, and allows you to be more in
 --- control of the project schedule and state.

 --- A platform for rapid web and mobile app development using pre-existing
 --- front-end modules and scalable back-end infrastructure. Baasic is a
 --- full-stack platform-as-a-service, covering both front and back-end
 --- aspects of web and mobile application development. It can be used with
 --- client-side javascript frameworks and all major server-side languages
 --- and technologies. You can even bring new life to your static HTML
 --- sites. However, we are well aware that one size never really fits all;
 --- that's why Baasic allows you to mix and match the right tools for each
 --- individual scenario. You don't have to start from scratch. Choose from
 --- a wide range of web or mobile application startup kits, ranging from
 --- simple sites to complex applications, all free and open-sourced. Use
 --- and customize built-in modules. If that isn't enough, you can create
 --- your own front-end components based on customized data models and make
 --- them first-class citizens in your applications. Use the tools you know
 --- and love. Baasic comes with an SDK for the language or framework you
 --- already use, so you never need to leave your comfort zone. Create as
 --- many applications as you want, scale them as needed. Set yourself free
 --- from server-side infrastructure setup and maintenance headaches. Small
 --- or large, we have you covered.

 --- Mono provides full-cycle .NET custom development services resulting in
 --- robust and scalable .NET web, desktop and mobile solutions that can
 --- run on virtually any environment. Weve been working with .NET from the
 --- early beta release of version 1.0 in late 2001. From early Win Forms
 --- and Web Forms applications, through more complex ASP.NET MVC layered
 --- architectures, to full blown, cloud-based solutions based on
 --- microservices, our team has always adopted the best engineering
 --- practices and built reliable and scalable software. We have started
 --- our .NET journey by building custom solutions and Web controls -
 --- scheduler, data grid, formatted textboxes, calendars, file managers,
 --- These products were successfully shipped through the early 2000s to
 --- thousands of end users. At the same time, weve built several versions
 --- of MonoX, a free and massively popular content management and social
 --- networking platform based on Web Forms and Web parts frameworks. It
 --- still powers hundreds of web sites and applications all over the
 --- world. More recently, we created Baasic, a completely modular,
 --- pluggable, scalable, secure and technology-agnostic framework and
 --- service for rapid development of web and mobile apps. Our team of
 --- experienced Microsoft-certified professionals can transform your ideas
 --- and requirements into flexible and highly scalable .NET web and mobile
 --- solutions that can run on virtually any environment. From mobile
 --- applications running on iOS, Android and Windows, to enterprise server
 --- applications running on Windows Server and Linux, or high-scale
 --- microservices running in the cloud, we are there for you.

 --- Mono develops high-quality cloud-based solutions for all cloud service
 --- models and environments. Mono team has been working with different
 --- cloud-based environments for more than 10 years. We have started with
 --- Amazons Elastic Compute Cloud and adopted Microsoft Azure services
 --- right after their official release in 2010. In parallel with our work
 --- with these public clouds, we have built and used complex private cloud
 --- environments, as well as hybrid models. Today, almost all of our
 --- solutions rely on at least several cloud-based services.  We gained
 --- significant experience with all cloud service models, including
 --- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), type of online services that hide
 --- the low-level details of underlying network infrastructure and
 --- physical resources via virtualization. This allows businesses to
 --- purchase resources on demand and as needed, instead of having to buy
 --- hardware outright, but still requires significant skills to maintain
 --- the infrastructure. Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides developers
 --- with a framework they can use to build custom applications upon,
 --- without having to deal with data serving, storage, management, and
 --- similar tasks.   Software as a Service (Saas) refers to cloud-based
 --- software solutions that are hosted online and are available for
 --- purchase on a subscription basis. Backend as a Service (BaaS) provides
 --- application developers with a mechanism to connect their applications
 --- to cloud storage and other computing services with APIs and SDKs
 --- exposed to their applications. We even built a complete BaaS solution
 --- from scratch and are using it as a backbone of many of our own
 --- solutions!

 --- We developed cloud-based real estate systems to satisfy specific
 --- business scenarios in the real estate industry, catering to the needs
 --- of real estate agents and their customers. Our goal was to develop an
 --- intuitive and user-friendly software solution for listing and
 --- presentation of different property types. Besides the responsive
 --- design and fully customizable back-end engine, we were focused on the
 --- integration of the real estate listings with various mapping and
 --- geolocation services. We have also developed a service for retrieving
 --- and automatic processing of listings and the accompanying resources
 --- (photos, documents) using third-party APIs used by different Multiple
 --- Listing Services (MLS). Our solution enables users to keep a complete
 --- overview of all client activities and build a detailed understanding
 --- of their preferences. A wealth of information sharing features
 --- promotes collaboration for the entire sales team. A customized
 --- reporting engine with intuitive dashboards allows users to visualize
 --- all relevant business data and use it for better decision making.
 --- Custom workflows cover all processes and tasks inside real-estate
 --- companies, from client interactions to back-office procedures.
