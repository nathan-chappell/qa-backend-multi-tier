 --- Mono development team can build mobile apps for every platform and
 --- purpose, using a wide array of cross-platform tools. We have started
 --- building mobile apps for iOS and Android platform using native
 --- development tools (Objective-C and Swift for iOS and Java for
 --- Android). More recently we have switched most of our projects to
 --- cross-development tools, using write-once-run-anywhere approach. Our
 --- mobile app projects share great amounts of code between platforms,
 --- enabling us to deliver mobile solutions at a fraction of the time and
 --- cost needed to build separate versions for each platform. In parallel
 --- with native development tools, we started using the first generation
 --- cross-platform JavaScript tools - PhoneGap and Ionic - a while ago.
 --- Their performance was not spectacular, so we switched to Xamarin
 --- quickly, as it was much better in terms of performance and
 --- functionality. It has also allowed us to utilize our large base of
 --- experienced C# developers to cover desktop, Web and mobile application
 --- development using a single set of tools. As React Native gained wider
 --- adoption, we started to use it in parallel with Xamarin; once again we
 --- were able to reuse our existing knowledge of JavaScript to build

 --- and traffic of goods, services, catering and tourist businesses; work
 --- and safety at work; electric power supply, mining and pressure
 --- vessels, and other fields regulated by special laws. eOcevidnik is a
 --- comprehensive eGovernment solution that covers all business scenarios
 --- for several hundreds of inspectors working for three separate
 --- ministries. The functionality and user interface have to be common
 --- across the organization, but the needs of inspectors in each
 --- particular administrative field are varying greatly. One of the main
 --- goals was to enable inter-institutional cooperation, by using Web
 --- services to exchange important information with other government
 --- bodies. Additionally, the Inspectorate's public Web site has to be
 --- synchronized with their intranet portal to allow for easy content
 --- publishing. Visitors of the public Web portal must have the ability to
 --- report various law violations and to track the statuses of their
 --- cases. Various forms must be available for electronic processing, and
 --- users' electronic signature is used to avoid paper-based submissions.
 --- Our initial development efforts were dedicated to delivering a bare
 --- functional prototype in just a few weeks. In the line of the agile
 --- development methodology and due to frequent legislative changes, new
 --- releases were issued frequently, emphasizing intensive communication
 --- with the client. Mono smart client framework solved most of the low

 ---   Our Development process. Business requirements are constantly
 --- evolving, so we use an agile, iterative and incremental approach to
 --- support and encourage these natural course changes.  We will work with
 --- you to blueprint a system that can be built efficiently to meet your
 --- needs. The idea is to help you define a minimal viable product, the
 --- first usable form of your application. Your requirements are broken
 --- down into small and manageable parts. Each of them describes a small
 --- piece of work needed to achieve results. This is where we start to get
 --- a sense of the amount of work involved. The time and price estimate
 --- for your new application is based on estimates for each individual
 --- task defined in the previous step. Summing it all up gives us the
 --- estimated completion date. Requirements can be added or changed at any
 --- time. Before development starts, all tasks are added to the product
 --- backlog - a list of requirements for a product. It contains everything
 --- needed to successfully deliver a viable product. A sprint (or
 --- iteration) is the basic unit of development. It usually lasts for a
 --- week or two and aims to implement a fixed number of backlog items. The
 --- goal of each sprint is to have a system that is integrated and ready
 --- for delivery. At the end of a sprint, the team reviews the sprint to
 --- articulate lessons learned and check progress. A new set of backlog
 --- items is chosen for the next sprint, and the work continues until the
 --- product is ready for the market. This process increases the quality of
 --- the final product, copes with changes, provides better estimates
 --- without spending too much time on them, and allows you to be more in
 --- control of the project schedule and state.

 --- Mono has built several applications that are used by medical
 --- researchers and practitioners in different fields. One of the
 --- solutions we built is used in brain tumor research and is powered by
 --- Python's Flask micro web framework. The application compiles
 --- information from various data sources into a single unified database,
 --- allowing researchers a better overview and processing of patient data.
 --- Anonymized patient data is tracked through the duration of the
 --- treatment period. The application's long-term goals are intended to
 --- improve tumor diagnosis using prediction modeling and statistical
 --- analysis. We are developing a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution
 --- for automating segmenting and classification of orthopedics MRI, using
 --- Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Algorithmic methods for MRI analysis
 --- fall into two general categories: classification and segmentation.
 --- Classification assigns a label to an MRI series: normal/abnormal,
 --- level of severity, or a diagnosis. Segmentation is the process of
 --- delineating the boundaries, or "contours," of various tissues and
 --- processes. Our service contains the functionality of both methods,
 --- with emphasis on segmentation, and will serve as a "virtual assistant"
 --- in interpreting MR scans to help radiologists in their everyday work.
 --- Our service functionality will include functionality for acquiring
 --- imaging results via DICOM standard, data pre-processing, processing of
 --- images using custom ML models, and displaying results in a user-
 --- friendly and intuitive fashion.

 --- relevance by incorporating cutting-edge machine learning algorithms
 --- (including Learning to Rank), secondary data sources, text analytics
 --- and natural language understanding (semantic tagging). Recommendations
 --- quality is enhanced by the data dynamically aggregated and
 --- extrapolated from the Facebook check-ins. The cold-start problem has
 --- been addressed by using users' friends' check-in data. To further
 --- improve how users interact with our systems, we embraced
 --- conversational interfaces and bots. We are using Microsoft Bot

 --- safety at work; electric power supply, mining and pressure vessels;
 --- and traffic of goods, services, catering and tourist businesses; work
 --- and safety at work; electric power supply, mining and pressure
 --- vessels, and other fields regulated by special laws. eOcevidnik is a
 --- comprehensive eGovernment solution that covers all business scenarios
 --- for several hundreds of inspectors working for three separate
 --- ministries. The functionality and user interface have to be common
 --- across the organization, but the needs of inspectors in each
 --- particular administrative field are varying greatly. One of the main
 --- goals was to enable inter-institutional cooperation, by using Web
 --- services to exchange important information with other government
 --- bodies. Additionally, the Inspectorate's public Web site has to be
 --- synchronized with their intranet portal to allow for easy content
 --- publishing. Visitors of the public Web portal must have the ability to
 --- report various law violations and to track the statuses of their
 --- cases. Various forms must be available for electronic processing, and
 --- users' electronic signature is used to avoid paper-based submissions.
 --- Our initial development efforts were dedicated to delivering a bare
 --- functional prototype in just a few weeks. In the line of the agile
 --- development methodology and due to frequent legislative changes, new
 --- releases were issued frequently, emphasizing intensive communication
 --- with the client. Mono smart client framework solved most of the low

question - How do you estimate time and price for an app?
q: 2
a: 1

answer - The time and price estimate for your new application is based on estimates for each individual task defined in the previous step.

 ---   Our Development process. Business requirements are constantly
 --- evolving, so we use an agile, iterative and incremental approach to
 --- support and encourage these natural course changes.  We will work with
 --- you to blueprint a system that can be built efficiently to meet your
 --- needs. The idea is to help you define a minimal viable product, the
 --- first usable form of your application. Your requirements are broken
 --- down into small and manageable parts. Each of them describes a small
 --- piece of work needed to achieve results. This is where we start to get
 --- a sense of the amount of work involved. The time and price estimate
 --- for your new application is based on estimates for each individual
 --- task defined in the previous step. Summing it all up gives us the
 --- estimated completion date. Requirements can be added or changed at any
 --- time. Before development starts, all tasks are added to the product
 --- backlog - a list of requirements for a product. It contains everything
 --- needed to successfully deliver a viable product. A sprint (or
 --- iteration) is the basic unit of development. It usually lasts for a
 --- week or two and aims to implement a fixed number of backlog items. The
 --- goal of each sprint is to have a system that is integrated and ready
 --- for delivery. At the end of a sprint, the team reviews the sprint to
 --- articulate lessons learned and check progress. A new set of backlog
 --- items is chosen for the next sprint, and the work continues until the
 --- product is ready for the market. This process increases the quality of
 --- the final product, copes with changes, provides better estimates
 --- without spending too much time on them, and allows you to be more in
 --- control of the project schedule and state.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---   We focus on providing intuitive user experiences and expert guidance
 --- on any level of product development life cycle. Sketching and
 --- prototyping the interface and user flows is a crucial first step. It
 --- is always more cost effective to change the sketches and prototypes
 --- than making changes at development or production stages. All of the
 --- prototypes go through a series of user experience and technical
 --- quality tests. It is recommended to organize real user testing
 --- sessions with the target audience to find out if and how they achieved
 --- their goals. After prototyping, the next step involves defining the
 --- aesthetics and visual language of the project. The end product of this
 --- phase is a set of high-resolution mockups of the interface and its
 --- elements as a style guide. A style guide defines all the necessary
 --- modules of the interface, simulates their states and behaviour and
 --- provides a base for scaling up the project without losing its visual
 --- and structural integrity. The final result of the design process is a
 --- working prototype of the interface. It is a high quality, live user
 --- interface, including all accompanying resources (HTML, CSS, JS,
 --- images, ...). It is the foundation for further development.

 ---   Building an Expression Engine. As workflows grew in complexity, our
 --- XMLs needed a full support of almost anything one might do in a
 --- programming language. We packed complex functionalities to tasks, but
 --- there were many custom math operations or data transformations that
 --- simply couldn't be defined in such a generic manner. We realized that
 --- we needed the ability to write small code snippets and use them to
 --- accomplish any kind of custom functionality, so we looked out for an
 --- expression engine being able to parse and run custom code.  As our
 --- workflow was actually a script of a sort, with variables defined
 --- dynamically on the fly, we thought the most suitable scripting
 --- language would be JavaScript. Since our code was written in .NET, our
 --- first solution was Microsoft's .NET implementation of a JavaScript V8
 --- engine - [ClearScript](https://github.com/microsoft/ClearScript). This
 --- implementation was used initially, until we realized that it had major
 --- performance problems. Looking further, we decided to try the (back
 --- then relatively new) Microsoft's .NET Compiler Platform
 --- [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) and run our scripts in C#.
 --- We never looked back since the performance was much faster than
 --- anything else we tried. There is an initial compilation penalty, but
 --- we reduced that by caching each of our snippets as dynamically
 --- generated assembly on disk, so we loaded it from there on every
 --- repeated run. This gave us the final ingredient for writing workflows
 --- with any kind of custom logic. The way our worklows looked at that
 --- point, we had an internal joke that we produced XML#.

 --- Mono provides full-cycle .NET custom development services resulting in
 --- robust and scalable .NET web, desktop and mobile solutions that can
 --- run on virtually any environment. Weve been working with .NET from the
 --- early beta release of version 1.0 in late 2001. From early Win Forms
 --- and Web Forms applications, through more complex ASP.NET MVC layered
 --- architectures, to full blown, cloud-based solutions based on
 --- microservices, our team has always adopted the best engineering
 --- practices and built reliable and scalable software. We have started
 --- our .NET journey by building custom solutions and Web controls -
 --- scheduler, data grid, formatted textboxes, calendars, file managers,
 --- These products were successfully shipped through the early 2000s to
 --- thousands of end users. At the same time, weve built several versions
 --- of MonoX, a free and massively popular content management and social
 --- networking platform based on Web Forms and Web parts frameworks. It
 --- still powers hundreds of web sites and applications all over the
 --- world. More recently, we created Baasic, a completely modular,
 --- pluggable, scalable, secure and technology-agnostic framework and
 --- service for rapid development of web and mobile apps. Our team of
 --- experienced Microsoft-certified professionals can transform your ideas
 --- and requirements into flexible and highly scalable .NET web and mobile
 --- solutions that can run on virtually any environment. From mobile
 --- applications running on iOS, Android and Windows, to enterprise server
 --- applications running on Windows Server and Linux, or high-scale
 --- microservices running in the cloud, we are there for you.

 --- Our solution automates purchase order processing, making life simpler
 --- for our clients that work with different suppliers and have branch
 --- offices in different locations. Our clients work with different
 --- supplies and materials and have branch offices in different locations.
 --- They have a number of vendors from which they can purchase the
 --- supplies, but the market is very competitive - each vendor offers
 --- different terms, prices, and quality of their merchandise. Our
 --- solution takes the hassle out of ordering process by automating the
 --- entire purchasing workflow. Our purchase order system includes the
 --- following features: a list of all supplies with aggregated vendor
 --- offers an easy-to-use order generation tool that sends out finished
 --- orders by email in various formats, order administration section
 --- (copying, templating, etc.), and a report section.  Orders are made on
 --- the branch office level, where users can choose who is to be billed
 --- for the order and where it is to be delivered. It generates unique
 --- purchase order numbers, and allow users to keep track of the orders
 --- they are responsible for. Supply and price lists, vendor SKUs and
 --- other important information, can be imported in XLS/CSV format, so no
 --- manual intervention is needed during the import process.
