Microservices.
Going further, we started using serverless computing - a code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests.
In terms of architecture, most of our new solutions use microservices approach, where applications are composed of small, independent and scalable customer-focused services that communicate over standard protocols and with well-defined interfaces.
Our team has extensive experience with many modern cloud service models and environments. We take pride in building top-notch cloud-based solutions, regardless of the complexity of your requirements.
