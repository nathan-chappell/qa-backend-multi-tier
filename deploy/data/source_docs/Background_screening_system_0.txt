Background screening system.
In todays world lots of information is accessible online sgetting to know someone is not a big problem if you have plenty of time to surf around and and manually retrieve and analyze every bit of information. 
A background check is a process a person or company uses tverify that a person is who they claim to be, and provides an opportunity for someone to check a persons criminal record, education, employment history, and other activities that happened in the past in order to confirm their validity. 
In majority of cases where background screening is needed, speed of the process plays a crucial role. When done manually or using outdated tools, the background checking process of a candidate can take days or weeks, especially if there are many candidates involved and a thorough check is required. There are many background screening services on the market, but none of them satisfied all functional requirements for this project. We were tasked with building a new solution making use of Machine Learning and other advanced technologies tmake the process faster and more accurate.
