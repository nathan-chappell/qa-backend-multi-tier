The goal of this project is to produce a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) system for automating segmenting and classification of orthopedics MRI, focusing on knee scans, using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Algorithmic methods for MRI analysis fall into two general categories: classification and segmentation. Classification assigns a label to an MRI series??normal/abnormal, level of severity, or a diagnosis. Segmentation is the process of delineating the boundaries, or contours, of various tissues and processes. Our system aims to contain functionality of both methods, and will serve as a virtual assistant in interpreting MR scans to help radiologists in their everyday work.
Finished system include functionality for acquiring imaging results via DICOM standard, data pre-processing, processing of images using appropriate ML models, and displaying results in an user-friendly and intuitive fashion. We have applied Class Activation Map (CAM) overlays on top of original scans to show which areas contributed the most to the classification outcome, signalizing which anatomic structures should be evaluated further for problems.
We intend to continue development of this product which by extending its scope to include support for processing other regions of body, as well as support for unlimited number of users using cloud-computing technologies.
