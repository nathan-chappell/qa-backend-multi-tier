We are the recipients of many notable Awards.
Mono holds a Gold Microsoft Partner status with Application Development and Independent Software Vendor competencies for more than 10 consecutive years. Gold partners are Microsoft's most highly accredited independent technical support providers.
We were awarded by Deloitte Technology Fast 50 in Central Europe 2013, a prestigious annual programme that honors the fastest growing Central European technology companies, based on the percentage of revenue growth over the five-year period.
We are also a National Champion in the organic growth category for The European Business Awards 2014/2015.
There is so much more about Mono than economic indicators and awards.
We cherish a great working atmosphere and believe in agile methodologies and continuous delivery. Our teams adapt quickly and efficiently. We are a one-stop provider and can handle all combinations of requirements gathering, architecture design, UX, testing, validation, maintenance, and support. We have an unmatched reputation for delivering responsive, expert and professional support. And, above all, we take a great deal of pride in what we do.
With great city comes a great community.
Our hometown is a software development hub with dozens of successful IT companies. Many of us are connected with Osijek Software Cityâ€”an association which goals are mainly focused on education and providing support for young developers and designers.
