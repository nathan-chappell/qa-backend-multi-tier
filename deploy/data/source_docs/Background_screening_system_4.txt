Id Verification.
Background check starts by user submitting search subject information. User submits all information he has access t Name, SSN, DOB, known addresses and aliases, etc.
System contacts data providers from the Id Verification category and confirms subject identity. It tries tfind unique match for the subject of the screening and if it does, it automatically selects that subject for later searches, collects aliases, addresses and other information that are re-used in later searches.
In case there are multiple subjects returned and system cannot determine subject identity with 100% confidence, user interaction is required. 
After all available data is collected, user can select which data wants tbe used in the later searches (aliases, addresses etc.).
After all searches are performed, user can review collected data, select content that needs tbe included in the final report, or alter automatic categorization. System tracks all user actions and is capable to make more accurate future decisions depending on the previous decisions and user actions on them.
In some cases, collecting data can take a long time (more than a few minutes). That happens mostly on providers that provide credit and court records because some of them prepare search results manually. In those cases, system does periodical checks for status update and notifies user when status changes.
