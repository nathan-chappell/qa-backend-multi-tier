sbaOpen is a worry-free solution for SBA lenders. sbaOpen is the only solution that automatically generates a complete set of eligibility criteria that both lenders and borrowers must follow. At the same time, sbaOpen automatically creates a set of documents that are required for loan submission to SBA.
After SBA approval is received, sbaOpen automatically generates a set of closing documents, and prepares documents needed in the funding phase.
