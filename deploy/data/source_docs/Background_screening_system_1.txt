The main goal of this project was timplement a scalable SaaS background check solution that covers all relevant data sources from social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), portals (Google, Bloomberg) or more official type of data including criminal or civil records provided by courts or other government institutions. All this information needs to be analyzed and aggregated to provide a comprehensive background check of a person or a business.
Services that provide this type of data can be public or paid, and they provide information in a myriad of various format  PDF, Word documents, JSON, HTML, etc. This mixture of unstuctured, semi-structured and structured data makes it very difficult tcollect, clean, parse, analyze, rate and categorize information and a lot of manual work is required to make a sense of it. Clients need comprehensive and complex reports on their subjects, and the existing products and services required a lot of copying and pasting between various data sources to produce deliverable documents. This process has to be automatized using Natural Language Understanding techniques and Robotic Process Automation tools.
Comprehensive UI was developed tenable investigators to quickly comprehend the status of each subject and perform their day-to-day tasks in the most efficient manner.
We have implemented a complete multi-tenant background screening SaaS system that was able thandle hundreds of candidates per day. It automates labor-intensive tasks common to the standard workflows, and results in a faster and more accurate process.  The coverage of the dataset is much wider compared to what it was before. Any suspicious activity now comes into focus more readily and helps an organization asses all relevant risks involved with the hiring process.
