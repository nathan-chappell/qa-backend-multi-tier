We have developed advanced techniques for handling Captcha challenges while making sure that none of target data sources are subject toverload or any other kind of unethical behavior. 
Multiple provider endpoints can be accessed in parallel via proxies, resulting in very fast data collection times. Operations that need hours using standard web crawlers are compressed tminutes. 
Advanced system configuration allows administrator tconfigure number of parallel tasks per domain, per proxy, limit total number of tasks - all depending on hardware configuration and other infrastructure used.
Scraping service is the main part of this solution and is responsible for collecting and rating background check information.
