Our team is based in Europe, allowing for at least several hours of time overlap with most of the developed world. If a project needs even closer collaboration, our team members can operate onshore. With more than 100 full time employees in technical roles, we can cover a lot of ground and successfully handle projects of all sizes. 
An alternative approach, known as dedicated development team, frees up your time completely to focus on companys core competencies and business side. Hired team is fully responsible for gathering the right human resources, managing the project, quality control and delivery. You enhance your business productivity, while software development is delegated to professionals from our team, with their own management and frameworks. 
Let us know if you would like to use team extension or dedicated development team model for building your next product of service. Our experience spans almost two decades and several hundreds completed projects.
